# Variable Translucent Windows in Ren'Py

The code snippets will:
- Add a Window Transparency slider to your settings window
- Allow the user to adjust the transparency of textboxes of your choice
- And also adjust the transparency of the menu window
- Overlays the game menu instead of outright replacing the screen so you can see changes

Follow the comments and replace the corresponding code in your personal project files.
